## Requirements

Students are required to install the following:
<ul>
<li>Anaconda for Python 3.4 or higher: https://www.continuum.io/downloads [i.e. NOT version 2.7]
<li>Jupyter Notebook (a.k.a. IPython Notebook): http://jupyter.readthedocs.org/en/latest/install.html#new-to-python-and-jupyter
<li>R or RStudio: https://cran.r-project.org/bin/ 


The installation process is straightforward, usually taking about 15 minutes. If you have any major issues, let me know at baisihad@bc.edu.

If you correctly installed 1 and 2, you should be able to open a Notebook by going to your Terminal (Mac) or Prompt (Windows) and typing "ipython notebook" or "jupyter notebook". You should also be able to open and run the ".ipynb" files above.
